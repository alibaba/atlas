 *     or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
 *     or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 *     granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
 *     as of the date such litigation is filed.

 *         excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 *         the Derivative Works; and
 *
 *     (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
 *         distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 *         include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 *         within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 *         pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 *         of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 *         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 *         documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 *         within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 *         wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 *         of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 *         do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution

 *         as modifying the License.
 *
 *     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 *     may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *     for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *     for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *     reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *     the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *     any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *     by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *     Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *     the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *     with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 *  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 *     names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *     except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 *     origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

 *     Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 *     WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 *     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 *     of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *     PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *     appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *     risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 *
 *  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *     whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *     unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *     negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *     liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *     result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *     Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *     work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *     other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *     has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *     the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *     and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *     or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *     License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *     on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *     of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *     defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *     incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *     of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 *
 *  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
